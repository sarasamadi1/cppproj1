This report addresses a comprehensive summary of the implementation and description of
book store system design that identifies the simulation of one day at the bookstore using C++

The purpose of this project is to construct a data structure that is applicable to build an
inventory system for a bookstore that stores books and add the new deliveries for it. Later, the
inventory changes depending on the daily arrivals of customers.
The below descriptions will describe the definition of the problem and why it is important
that we need the solution of it, following the description of the solution and how that
provided solution is approached.
This system will provide a great guide for storing information as this inventory management
software program can also help in updating the database and organizing the inventory.
